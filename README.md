# Hangman Game - Python Basics Exercise

This Hangman game project was developed as part of a Python basics course. It serves as a practical exercise to reinforce key Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, nested conditionals, and tuples.

## About the Game

- **Objective:** Guess the hidden word by entering one letter at a time.
- **Rules:** You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly.
- **Challenge:** Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman being drawn.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `hangman.py` script in a Python environment to start the game.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the hidden word.

## Technologies Used

- Python

## Acknowledgments

This project is a product of learning and practice. It demonstrates the application of fundamental Python programming concepts and serves as a stepping stone for more complex projects.

Feel free to explore the code and have fun playing Hangman!
